Remember that any changes to the article body will be updated in **all** shared content articles.\\n\\nFor information on what gets shared and how, see [Shared content\\narticles](/help/shared-content-articles \"Shared content articles\").\\n\\n## URL redirect article\\n\\nWhat if the content you'd like to include in your knowledge base isn't IN your\\nknowledge base? Maybe you'd like to reference the page of another site, or a\\npress packet your PR department has put together.\\n\\nYou can set up both categories and articles as URL redirects. For articles,\\nthis means you can administer the article as an article (restrict it to\\ngroups, restrict editing to teams, use the article call-outs, assign related\\narticles) but when someone clicks on the title of the article or navigates to\\nthe URL, they'll be redirected to the URL you set up, instead.\\n\\nURL redirects can be great when used with:\\n\\n  * Links to external sites/files you don't want or can't move into KnowledgeOwl\\n  * Links to files stored within KnowledgeOwl, where you want the file to open directly (See the [KnowledgeOwl W-9](/help/knowledgeowl-w9 \"KnowledgeOwl W-9\") for an example of this type!)\\n\\nURL redirect articles will not display in the [Popular Articles\\nReport](/help/popular-articles-report \"Popular Articles Report\") or the\\n[Published Articles with 0 Views](/help/published-articles-with-0-views\\n\"Published Articles with 0 Views\") report, since we do not currently track\\nview data for this article type.\\n\\nYou can create a new article as a URL redirect or convert an existing article\\nto be a URL redirect. To do so:\\n\\n  1. Check the URL Redirect box in the righthand menu of the article editor:  \\n\\n  2. Once checked, this will add a section between the full article title and the editor where you can add the URL you'd like to redirect to:  \\n\\n  3. Now, add the URL you'd like to redirect to.\\n    1. For external URLs, type or paste the URL you'd like to use into the **Redirect URL** field. Here, we're redirecting to the International Owl Center's Owl Glossary page:  \\nSample external redirect URL\\n\\n    2. To redirect to a file uploaded to KnowledgeOwl (or to directly upload a file to KnowledgeOwl to redirect to), click the **Redirect to File** button:  \\nClick the Redirect to File button\\n\\n      1. This will open an Add file from Library pop-up where you can select the file you'd like to insert. Browse or search for the file. (Or click **Upload New File** to add a new one.) Click on it to select it, then click the **Insert File** button in the lower right.  \\nSelect the file you'd like to redirect to and click Insert File\\n\\n      2. The URL of the file will be added to the **Redirect URL** field:  \\nRedirect article with a KO file URL used\\n\\n  4. Set whether you'd like the redirect link to open in a new tab or in the same tab. (Open link in new tab is used by default.)  \\n\\n  5.  **Save** your article.\\n\\nURL redirect articles do not work within topic display categories that use the\\n**Override Article Links** setting. This is because the override gets applied\\nbefore the URL redirect.\\n\\nTo switch an article from being a URL redirect to being a normal article,\\nuncheck the \"Redirect this article to a different URL\" box. Once you save, the\\narticle will function normally and display whatever content is in the editor.\\n\\nAnything included in the body of the article _will still be indexed for\\nsearch_ even though it won't be displayed. You can use this to your advantage\\nto help provide additional words or terminology to help people find this\\narticle!\\n====================\\n</td>\n",
