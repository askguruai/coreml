The government says the country needs to protect its energy security and the environment, as glaciers melt rapidly in the Swiss Alps. The law will require a move away from dependence on imported oil and gas towards the use of renewable sources. In Sunday's referendum 59.1% of voters backed the green energy proposals. Opponents had argued the measures would push up energy prices. Nearly all of Switzerland's major parties supported the bill, except the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), which triggered the referendum after pushing back against the government's proposals. Switzerland imports about three-quarters of its energy, with all the oil and natural gas consumed coming from abroad. The climate bill pledges financial support of 2bn Swiss francs ($2.2bn; Â£1.7bn) over a decade to promote the replacement of gas or oil heating systems with climate-friendly alternatives, and SFr1.2bn to push businesses towards green innovation.",
